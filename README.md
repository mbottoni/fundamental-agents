# Fundamental Stock Analysis with multi agent outline

"Develop a commercial-grade, multi-agent AI platform designed to perform comprehensive fundamental stock analysis. The platform will feature an intuitive, data-rich user interface where users can input a stock ticker and receive a detailed, synthesized report generated by a team of specialized AI agents. These agents will collaborate to gather financial data, analyze market sentiment, calculate key valuation metrics, and generate a final, coherent investment thesis. The platform will be architected for scalability, reliability, and security, with a seamless Stripe integration to manage user subscriptions for tiered access to its analytical capabilities. The end-goal is to empower retail and professional investors with institutional-quality insights, delivered through a polished and monetizable SaaS product."

Detailed Project Outline & Phased Plan
This plan breaks the project into manageable phases, from core logic to production deployment.

Phase 1: Core Agent Framework & Data Aggregation
The goal of this phase is to build the "brain" of your application. The agents must be able to perform their analysis independent of any UI.

1. Define Agent Roles:

Data-Gathering Agent: Fetches raw data from various sources:

Financial statements (Income, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow) from APIs.

Recent news articles and press releases related to the stock.

Stock price history.

Financial-Metrics Agent: Takes raw financial data and calculates key ratios and metrics (e.g., P/E, P/B, Debt-to-Equity, ROE, Free Cash Flow).

News-Sentiment Agent: Processes news articles to determine the overall sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) and identify key themes or risks.

Valuation Agent: Uses metrics and growth assumptions to perform valuation modeling (e.g., Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), comparable company analysis).

Synthesis & Reporting Agent: The "lead" agent. It receives the structured output from all other agents and compiles it into a single, human-readable report with a summary, key findings, and final conclusion.

2. Choose Technology Stack:

Language: Python (ideal for data analysis and AI).

Agent Framework: Consider frameworks like LangChain or Microsoft AutoGen to manage agent interactions, state, and workflows.

Data Libraries: pandas for data manipulation, requests & beautifulsoup4 for data fetching/scraping.

Data Source APIs:

Financial Modeling Prep or Alpha Vantage: For financial statements and metrics.

NewsAPI or web scraping for news aggregation.

3. Develop and Test Agents:

Build each agent as a modular class or function.

Create a master script that orchestrates the workflow: User inputs a ticker -> Data Agent runs -> Metrics & News Agents run in parallel -> Valuation Agent runs -> Synthesis Agent creates the final report.

The output should be a structured JSON object or a Markdown file.

Phase 2: Backend Server & API
This phase connects your core logic to the web, allowing a frontend to interact with it.

1. Build the API:

Framework: FastAPI (Python) is highly recommended for its speed, automatic documentation, and compatibility with your Python-based agents.

Endpoints:

POST /api/v1/auth/register: Create a new user account.

POST /api/v1/auth/login: Authenticate a user and return a JWT token.

POST /api/v1/analysis: Kicks off a new stock analysis job (takes a stock ticker). Returns a job_id.

GET /api/v1/analysis/{job_id}: Checks the status of an analysis job (e.g., "pending", "in_progress", "complete").

GET /api/v1/reports/{report_id}: Fetches the final analysis report.

POST /api/v1/stripe/create-checkout-session: Initiates the Stripe payment flow.

POST /api/v1/stripe/webhook: Listens for events from Stripe (e.g., successful payment).

2. Database:

System: PostgreSQL is a robust and scalable choice.

ORM: SQLAlchemy with Pydantic models for data validation.

Schema:

users table: id, email, password_hash, stripe_customer_id, subscription_status.

analysis_jobs table: id, user_id, ticker, status, report_id.

reports table: id, content (JSON or Text), created_at.

Phase 3: Frontend User Interface
This is the user-facing part of your application.

1. Choose Technology Stack:

Framework: React or Next.js (Next.js is recommended for its built-in routing and server-side rendering capabilities).

Styling: Tailwind CSS for rapid and responsive UI development.

Charting: Recharts or Chart.js to visualize financial data.

State Management: React Context or Zustand for managing global state like user authentication.

2. Build UI Components:

Pages:

Landing/Marketing Page

Pricing Page

Login & Registration Pages

Dashboard (shows user's past reports)

Analysis Page (input for a new ticker, shows loading state)

Report View (displays the final report with text, charts, and key metrics).

Interactive Elements:

Clean forms for input.

Loading spinners and progress indicators for analysis jobs.

Data tables and interactive charts for the report.

Phase 4: Monetization - Stripe Integration
1. Backend Logic:

Use the stripe-python library.

Define subscription plans (e.g., Basic Free Tier, Premium Monthly).

Implement the create-checkout-session endpoint to redirect users to Stripe's hosted payment page.

Securely handle the Stripe webhook to update user subscription status in your database.

2. Frontend Logic:

Create a Pricing page detailing your subscription tiers.

"Subscribe" buttons call your backend's checkout endpoint.

Implement logic to gate features based on the user's subscription_status. For example, a free user might get 3 free reports, while a premium user has unlimited access.

Phase 5: Deployment & Operations
1. Containerization:

Use Docker to containerize your backend and frontend applications.

Create a docker-compose.yml file for easy local development.

2. Cloud Infrastructure:

Cloud Provider: AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.

Backend Deployment: Deploy the backend container to a service like AWS Fargate, Google Cloud Run, or a virtual machine.

Frontend Deployment: Deploy the frontend to a service like Vercel (ideal for Next.js) or AWS S3/CloudFront.

Database: Use a managed database service like AWS RDS or Google Cloud SQL.

3. CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment):

Set up GitHub Actions to automatically run tests and deploy your code to the cloud when you push to your main branch.
